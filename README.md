## This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify customer reviews or feedback as either positive or negative. We will implement a machine learning-based solution to analyze customer sentiments, helping businesses understand their customers' feelings, improve products, and enhance service quality.
# Key Concepts
> Sentiment Analysis: The process of determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, typically classifying it into categories like positive, negative, or neutral.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): A subfield of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human languages, enabling machines to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.
Machine Learning: A method of data analysis that automates analytical model building using algorithms that allow the computer to learn from the data.
